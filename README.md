# Chess_Project
This project is a fully interactive two-player chess game created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows players to enjoy a smooth and responsive gameplay experience directly in their browser, with features such as drag-and-drop piece movement, highlighted legal moves, and support for all standard chess rules, including check, checkmate, stalemate, castling, en passant, and pawn promotion. The design is mobile-friendly and enhanced with clean visuals, smooth animations, optional sound effects, and customizable themes to create an engaging and modern interface. This project is ideal for learning web development concepts, practicing logic implementation, or simply enjoying a classic game of chess with a friend online or offline.
